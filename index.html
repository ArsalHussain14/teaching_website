    <h1>How to use git</h1>

    <p>this section will explain how to use git</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Initialize Git on a folder, making it a Repository</li>   
        <li>Git now creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes in that folder
        </li>   
        <li>When a file is changed, added or deleted, it is considered modified
        </li>   
        <li>You select the modified files you want to Stage
        </li>   
        <li>The Staged files are Committed, which prompts Git to store a permanent snapshot of the files
        </li>
        <li>Git allows you to see the full history of every commit.
        </li>
        <li>You can revert back to any previous commit.
        </li>
        <li>Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit, but keeps track of changes made in each commit!</li>
    </ul>
